\subsection*{Exercise 2}
If a stoplight in Metropolis has six cars stopped at it, and each car is a taxi independently with probability 1/2, what is the probability that there are three yellow taxis in a row at the traffic light?\\

\subsection*{Exercise 3}
What is the probability that Clara wins Damien's ace of diamonds on the first move of the game? 
\begin{proof}
1. Prod(C\&D tie with aces AND C wins war) = Prod(C\&D tie with aces) Prod(C wins war|C\&D tie with aces) = 1/13 * 1/13 * 1/2 = 1/338 \\
2. Prod(C\&D tie with non-aces AND D's ace is in next 3 cards AND C wins war) = 12/13 * 1/13 * 3/12 Prod(C wins war|C\&D tied and D's ace was in next 3 cards) = 3/169 * (1/12 + 11/12 * 1/2) = 3/169 * 13/24 = 1/104 \\
3. Prod(C\&D tie with non-aces AND C\&D tie with aces in the war AND C wins the coin-flip) = 12/13 * 1/13 * 1/12 * 1/12 * 1/2 = 1/4056\\
Final = case 1 + case 2 + case 3 (they are independent) = 1/338 + 1/104 + 1/4056 = (12 + 39 + 1)/4056 = 1/78
\end{proof}


\subsection*{Exercise 4}
60\% of written test applicants have studied. \\ 
75\% of written test applicants pass the test. \\
Given that an applicant didn't study, he or she has a 50\% chance of passing. \\
What is the probability that an applicant who passes the test studied for it?
