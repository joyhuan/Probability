Probability and Stochastic Process

I got my worst grade in Probability because I took seven classes that semester. But that should not 
be an excuse; I tried to remedy that by taking a Grad Stochatic Process class, did better, but still
not good enough. So after 2 years, I'm finally determined to dig in deep to the subject and be really
good at it :)
