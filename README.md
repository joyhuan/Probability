# Probability and Stochastic Process

I got my worst grade in Probability because I took seven classes that semester. But that should not 
be an excuse; I tried to remedy that by taking a Grad Stochatic Process class, did better, but still
not good enough. So after two years, I'm finally determined to dig in deep to the subject and be really
good at it.

Besides the refusion of resignation, there are four extra motivations: 
1. Munger says Pascal math is important (humans are not designed to be good at weighing pros and cons by evolution; honing Pascal math helps overcome gullibility)

2. the Rule 19 Use-It-or-Lose-It tendency

3. Revisiting is my way of learning. To best explain how I learn best, I will use an analogy - if you ever learned sketch, you know that the light effects are rendered by painting layer by layer. I absorb stuff in a similar way, layer of layer, revisiting makes the core pop up and the margins fade away. 

4. Probability is just gorgeous. If you don't feel awed in this equation, you're just not as a geek as me :)
